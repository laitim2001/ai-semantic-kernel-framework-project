Purpose: Sprint 50.1 acceptance e2e — "user asks echo X → loop replies X".
Category: Integration tests / Sprint 50.1 acceptance gate
Scope: Phase 50 / Sprint 50.1 (Day 4.1)

Description:
    The Sprint 50.1 acceptance criterion (per sprint-50-1-plan.md §Story 50.1-6):
        user message → AgentLoop.run() → MockChatClient yields tool_call →
        echo_tool execute → MockChatClient yields END_TURN → final answer.

    THIS test asserts deep semantics that complement Day 3 integration test:
        a) Full event sequence with ordering AND counts.
        b) ChatRequest progression — each chat() round receives the right
           messages list (user, assistant w/ tool_calls, tool result, ...).
        c) Final assistant content carries the echo result back to user.
        d) Loop terminates with END_TURN reason at expected turn count.

    Day 4.2 (test_observability_coverage) further verifies tracer / metric
    emission against this same scenario.
