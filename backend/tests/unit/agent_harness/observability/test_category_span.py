File: backend/tests/unit/agent_harness/observability/test_category_span.py
Purpose: AD-Cat12-Helpers-1 closure — verify category_span primitive behaves as no-op-or-span.
Category: Tests / 範疇 12 (Observability — cross-cutting)
Scope: Sprint 55.3

Description:
    `category_span` is the cross-cutting span primitive owned by Cat 12;
    `verification_span` (54.2) and `business_service_span` (55.1) delegate
    here. Tests verify:
      1. tracer=None → no-op (yields without exception, no span emit attempt)
      2. tracer present → start_span called with correct name + category;
         body executes within ctx mgr; span recorded
      3. Sequential calls accumulate spans in tracer in order
