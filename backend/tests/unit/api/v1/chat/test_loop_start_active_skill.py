Purpose: Unit tests for the Sprint 57.116 additive `active_skill` field on loop_start.
Category: tests
Scope: Phase 57 / Sprint 57.116 (Skills Inspector affordance)

Description:
    The opening loop_start SSE event gains an additive `active_skill: string | null`
    field so chat-v2 can chip the user turn with a force-loaded skill. The Cat-1
    loop has no concept of "skill" → the sse.py serializer defaults it null; the
    chat router (router._stream_loop_events) injects the validated force-load name
    on the loop_start frame. These tests lock: the serializer default is present
    (required by the WIRE_SCHEMA parity guard), the registry declares the field,
    and active_skill is an additive field (not a new top-level wire type).

Created: 2026-06-14 (Sprint 57.116)
Modified: 2026-06-16 (Sprint 57.130 — wire count 24→25 via loop_terminated; renamed count test)
