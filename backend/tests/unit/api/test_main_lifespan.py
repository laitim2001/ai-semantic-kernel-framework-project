Purpose: Verify api.main._lifespan() startup wiring (.env autoload + pricing loader).
Category: tests / api boundary
Scope: Sprint 57.6 US-2 (R2 / closes AD-Reality-2 + 57.5 D-20) + FIX-022 (§5.1 H1)

Description:
    Sprint 57.5 reality check found AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY etc. were not loaded
    from .env when uvicorn started, causing real_llm chat mode to 503. Fix is
    to call load_dotenv() at the top of api.main._lifespan() so process env
    populates before settings / adapter initialization.

    This test pins the regression: patch `api.main.load_dotenv`, drive the
    FastAPI lifespan via TestClient context-manager enter/exit, assert the
    patched function was called exactly once on startup.

Created: 2026-05-08 (Sprint 57.6 Day 1)

Modification History:
    - 2026-05-31: FIX-022 — add test_lifespan_wires_pricing_loader_from_yaml (§5.1 H1)
    - 2026-05-08: Sprint 57.6 US-2 — initial creation (closes AD-Reality-2)

Related:
    - backend/src/api/main.py L72-86 — `_lifespan()` calling load_dotenv()
    - backend/requirements.txt — `python-dotenv>=1.0,<2.0`
    - 57.5 reality check D-20 — `0 dotenv import` in backend/src baseline
