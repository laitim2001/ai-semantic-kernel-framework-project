Purpose: Single-source ErrorContext + base exception hierarchy for Cat 8 Error Handling.
Category: cross-category single-source contracts (per 17.md §1)
Scope: Phase 53.2 / Sprint 53.2

Description:
    Defines the data model that any range Cat 8 implementation (`error_handling/`)
    consumes when classifying or routing exceptions:
      - `ErrorContext` (frozen dataclass): metadata about the failure point
        (source category / tool / provider / attempt count / state version).
      - Base exceptions for the 4-class taxonomy mapping that the stub
        `_abc.py::ErrorClass` enum already declares (TRANSIENT /
        LLM_RECOVERABLE / HITL_RECOVERABLE / FATAL).

    These are pure-data declarations — no IO, no dependencies on
    LLM SDKs, no business logic. Cat 8 concrete implementations
    (`error_handling/policy.py`) and adapter integrations import
    from here.

Key Components:
    - ErrorContext: frozen dataclass passed alongside the raw exception
    - AuthenticationError / MissingDataError: USER_FIXABLE (HITL_RECOVERABLE)
      base classes. Concrete adapters subclass.
    - ToolExecutionError: LLM_RECOVERABLE base class for tool-side failures
      that should be returned to the LLM as an error ToolResult instead
      of bubbling up.

        source_category: name of the calling range — e.g. "tools" /

        tool_name: tool identifier when the exception came from tool
            execution (Cat 2). Optional.
        provider: LLM provider identifier when the exception came from

        attempt_num: 1-indexed attempt count within the current retry
            cycle. Used by RetryPolicy.should_retry caps.
        state_version: Cat 7 state version reference at the moment of
            failure. Optional — useful for audit / debug trace correlation.
        tenant_id: multi-tenant boundary attribute (per
            multi-tenant-data.md). Optional but should be populated by
            Loop integration in 53.2 Day 3-4.
