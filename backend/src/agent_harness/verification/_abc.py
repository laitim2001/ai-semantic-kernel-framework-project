Purpose: Category 10 ABC — Verifier (output verification + self-correction).
Category: 範疇 10 (Verification Loops)
Scope: Phase 49 / Sprint 49.1 (stub; impl in Phase 54.1)

Description:
    Verifier checks LLM output before it leaves the loop.
    Implementations may be rules-based (regex / schema check),
    LLM-judge (subagent verifies), or external (call to API).

    On failure, the loop may trigger self-correction (max 2 attempts
    per spec) by feeding suggested_correction back to LLM.

Owner: 01-eleven-categories-spec.md §範疇 10
Single-source: 17.md §2.1

Created: 2026-04-29 (Sprint 49.1)
Last Modified: 2026-06-13

Modification History (newest-first):
    - 2026-06-13: Sprint 57.111 A3 — widen state to LoopState | None (trace-aware; drops cast-None)
    - 2026-04-29: Initial creation (Sprint 49.1)
