Purpose: RulesBasedVerifier — fail-fast Rules runner; cheap verifier (p95 < 200ms).
Category: 範疇 10 (Verification Loops)
Scope: Sprint 54.1 US-1

Description:
    Concrete Verifier that delegates to a list of Rule instances. Returns
    VerificationResult on the first failing rule (fail-fast); returns
    passed=True when all rules pass.

    State / trace_context parameters required by Verifier ABC are accepted
    but unused — RulesBasedVerifier is stateless by design (no LLM call,
    no external IO). The 200ms SLO is achievable because each Rule.check()
    is a sync local operation (regex / json / callable).
