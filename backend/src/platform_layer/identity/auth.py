File: backend/src/platform_layer/identity/auth.py
Purpose: FastAPI dependencies — get_current_tenant + get_current_user_id from
JWT-decoded request.state populated by TenantContextMiddleware.
Category: Platform layer / Identity (cross-cutting; multi-tenant 鐵律 3 dep)
Scope: Sprint 52.5 Day 1.2 (P0 #14 — replaces middleware/{tenant,auth}.py V1 stubs)
Owner: platform_layer/identity owner

Description:
    These deps are the *single canonical source* for tenant/user identity
    in V2. Every business endpoint MUST use them (or downstream wrappers
    like `get_db_session_with_tenant`) to ensure tenant_id is taken from
    the verified JWT, never from request bodies / query params / headers.

    `request.state.tenant_id` and `request.state.user_id` are populated
    by `TenantContextMiddleware` (Day 6.1 will rewrite that middleware
    to JWT-decode; Day 1.2 ships the deps + JWTManager so endpoints can
    declare `Depends(get_current_tenant)` immediately).

    Until Day 6.1 lands, callers will receive 401 because middleware
    still reads X-Tenant-Id (no user_id set). This is acceptable: the
    failing-fast behaviour is preferable to silent fallback to header
    spoofing — i.e. no production endpoint shall be wired up until the
    middleware change is in.

Key Components:
    - get_current_tenant(request) -> UUID
    - get_current_user_id(request) -> UUID

Created: 2026-05-01 (Sprint 52.5 Day 1.2)
Last Modified: 2026-05-01

Modification History:
    - 2026-05-04: Add require_approver_role RBAC dep + extract _require_role helper
        (Sprint 53.5 US-1 — approver / admin / manager)
    - 2026-05-04: Add require_audit_role RBAC dep (Sprint 53.5 US-5 — auditor / admin / compliance)
    - 2026-05-01: Initial creation (Sprint 52.5 Day 1.2) — replaces V1 stubs
