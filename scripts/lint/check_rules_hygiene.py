File: scripts/lint/check_rules_hygiene.py
Purpose: Always-loaded rule-file hygiene lint — size budgets on .claude/rules/*
    + CLAUDE.md, and a 400-char cap on calibration-matrix.md table rows.
Category: Cross-cutting / DevOps tooling
Scope: REFACTOR-011 (2026-07-14)

Description:
    Claude Code auto-loads CLAUDE.md + every .claude/rules/*.md into EVERY
    session's context. Twice (REFACTOR-005 2026-05-31, REFACTOR-009
    2026-07-14) the sprint-workflow.md scope-class matrix re-accumulated
    full per-sprint narration in its status cells (~2000+ chars/cell, 47%
    of the file) because the only guard was an advisory prose note — each
    sprint closeout copied the previous bloated cell as its template and
    nothing failed. This lint is the missing mechanical guard:

    Check A — matrix row cap: every table row in calibration-matrix.md
        (lines starting "| `") must be <= MATRIX_ROW_MAX chars. Full
        narration belongs in calibration-log.md §1 (+ the sprint's memory
        subfile + retrospective.md), never in the matrix cell.
    Check B — size budgets: each always-loaded file must stay under its
        byte budget (current size + ~25-40% headroom). Exceeding a budget
        means evidence/history is accumulating in a rules file — move it
        to an on-demand doc (docs/rules-on-demand/ or calibration-log).
    A budgeted file that is MISSING is also a violation: if the file was
    intentionally moved/renamed, update SIZE_BUDGETS consciously here.

Key Components:
    - Violation: NamedTuple (file, kind, detail). NamedTuple, NOT @dataclass:
      tests load this script via importlib file-path (Sprint 57.165 lesson —
      @dataclass + future-annotations breaks under importlib module loading).
    - find_violations(repo_root): pure function; unit-testable via tmp_path.
    - main(): CLI wrapper; exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations found.

Usage:
    python scripts/lint/check_rules_hygiene.py [--root <repo_root>]
