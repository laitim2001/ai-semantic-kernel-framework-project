## Overview

This document enforces the **mandatory 5-step sprint execution flow** used in V2 (Phase 49+). Phase 35-38 violated this flow by skipping plan + checklist, leading to scattered implementation and poor traceability.

**Golden Rule**: `Phase README → Sprint Plan → Sprint Checklist → Code → Update Checklist → Progress Doc`

---

## Mandatory 5-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Create Plan File

**Before writing any code**, create sprint plan at `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-planning/phase-XX-name/sprint-XX-Y-plan.md`.

**Required Sections**:
- **Sprint Goal**: One sentence. What does this sprint deliver?
- **User Stories**: 3-5 stories in "As a / I want / So that" format
- **Technical Specifications**: Design decisions, architecture rationale, technology choices
- **File Change List**: Explicit list of all files to be created/modified (with counts)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable, testable definition of done
- **Deliverables**: `- [ ]` checkbox list mapping to stories
- **Dependencies & Risks**: What could block? What's the mitigation?

**Reference Template**: `phase-49-foundation/sprint-49-1-plan.md` (follow structure exactly)

**Why**: Prevents vague scope. Forces thinking before coding. Becomes sprint contract.

**Violation Pattern** ❌: "I'll start coding and see what happens" → scattered PRs → unclear scope → Phase 35-38 repeat.

---

### Step 2: Create Checklist File

**Immediately after plan approval**, create sprint checklist at `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-planning/phase-XX-name/sprint-XX-Y-checklist.md`.

**Required Format**:
```markdown
# Sprint XX.Y — Checklist

[Link to plan]

## Day N — Task Group (Estimated X hours)

### N.M Task Description (Y min)
- [ ] **Specific deliverable**
  - Estimated: Y min
  - DoD: Measurable definition of done
  - Command: `git ...` or `pytest ...`
- [ ] **Next deliverable**
  - ...
```

**Key Rules**:
- Use `- [ ]` format
- Each task ≤ 60 min (break down longer)
- Include DoD (Definition of Done) — how to verify
- Map each task to plan's acceptance criteria
- Assign to days (Day 1-5 for typical sprint)

**Reference Template**: `phase-49-foundation/sprint-49-1-checklist.md` (121 tasks over 5 days)

**Violation Pattern** ❌ (Phase 42 Sprint 147): Deleting unchecked `[ ]` items when scope shrinks. This hides what was planned vs. what shipped.

✅ **Correct behavior**: Only change `[ ]` → `[x]`. If scope cuts, leave `[ ]` and note reason in progress.md.

---

### Step 3: Implement Code

**Only after both plan + checklist exist**.

**Workflow**:
1. Review sprint plan + checklist
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/sprint-XX-Y-<scope>` (use scope from git-workflow.md)
3. Code against checklist deliverables (one at a time)
4. Commit frequently (one logical unit per commit)

**Prohibited** ❌:
- Starting code before plan/checklist approved
- Committing without checklist entry
- Scope creep without updating plan + checklist

---

### Step 4: Update Checklist During Implementation

**Daily workflow**:
- Morning: Review today's checklist tasks
- As you complete: `[ ]` → `[x]` (change, never delete)
- If blocked: Add notation `🚧 阻塞：<reason>` below the task, continue working or escalate
- End of day: Commit checklist updates

**Sacred Rule** (Phase 42 Sprint 147 violation):
- ❌ **Never delete** `[ ]` items that weren't done
- ❌ **Never hide** scope cuts by removing lines
- ✅ **Always mark**: `[x]` when done, `[ ]` when not (or abandon formally)

**Why**: Traceability. In retrospective, we see what was planned vs. shipped.

---

### Step 5: Create Progress & Documentation

**Daily (evening)**:
- Update `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-execution/phase-XX/sprint-XX-Y/progress.md`
- Format:
  ```markdown
  # Sprint XX.Y Progress — YYYY-MM-DD

  ## Today's Accomplishments
  - Task X.Y completed (approx. Z min under/over estimate)
  - Issue: blockers, discoveries

  ## Remaining for Next Day
  - Task X.Z (pre-work done)

  ## Notes
  - Learning / decision / risk
  ```

**Sprint end**:
- Create `retrospective.md` covering: did well / improve next sprint / action items + estimate accuracy %

**What NOT to do** ❌:
- "We'll update docs after the sprint" → too late, details lost
- Skip retrospective → patterns repeat
- Generic notes ("worked on stuff") → no data for future planning

---

## Change Record Conventions

When fixing bugs or implementing features, create corresponding document in `claudedocs/4-changes/`:

| Type | Directory | Naming | When |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| Bug Fix | `4-changes/bug-fixes/` | `FIX-XXX-description.md` | Any bug fix |
| Feature Change | `4-changes/feature-changes/` | `CHANGE-XXX-description.md` | Feature enhancement |
| Refactoring | `4-changes/refactoring/` | `REFACTOR-XXX-description.md` | Code restructure |

**Format** (1 page):
```markdown
# FIX-123: <Description>

**Date**: 2026-05-15
**Sprint**: 50.2
**Scope**: <11+1 category or cross-cutting>

## Problem
2-3 sentences. What was broken?

## Root Cause
Analysis. Why did it happen?

## Solution
What we changed. Code location. PR reference.

## Verification
How we confirmed it's fixed (test name, manual steps).

## Impact
Scope of fix (backend-only? frontend? integration?).
```

**Daily Workflow**:
1. **Morning**: Check `claudedocs/3-progress/daily/` latest log
2. **When fixing bug**: Create `claudedocs/4-changes/bug-fixes/FIX-XXX-<issue>`
3. **When changing feature**: Create `claudedocs/4-changes/feature-changes/CHANGE-XXX-<feature>`
4. **End of day**: Use SITUATION-5 to save progress (which creates daily log entry)

## Sprint Naming & Directory Structure

**Standard format** (from 06-phase-roadmap.md):

```
phase-XX-name/
├── sprint-XX-Y-plan.md           ← Must exist before coding
├── sprint-XX-Y-checklist.md      ← Must exist before coding
└── ...

agent-harness-execution/
└── phase-XX/
    └── sprint-XX-Y/
        ├── progress.md           ← Daily entries during sprint
        ├── retrospective.md      ← End of sprint
        └── artifacts/            ← Evidence files
```

**Branch naming** (from git-workflow.md):
```
feature/sprint-XX-Y-<scope>
```

**Commit messages**:
```
feat(<scope>, sprint-XX-Y): <description>

## Common Violation Patterns & Consequences

| Pattern | Evidence | Why Bad | Fix |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|
| **Skip Plan** | Code appears without plan.md | Unknown scope → unclear PR → rework | Always: plan → checklist → code |
| **Skip Checklist** | Implementation doesn't track tasks | Can't measure progress; retro blind | Checklist = truth table; mandatory |
| **Delete `[ ]` items** | Checklist shrinks mid-sprint | Hides scope cuts; retro can't diagnose (Phase 42) | Only mark `[x]` or note `[阻塞]` |
| **Update checklist after sprint** | Checklist retroactively filled in | Data quality → estimates useless | Update daily, during work |
| **Skip progress.md** | "Will write at end" | Details lost; retro weak | Write daily 10-min entry |
| **No Change records** | Bugs fixed in silence | No audit trail; same bug reappears | FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR every time |
| **Vague DoD** | "Implement X" → what counts as done? | Infinite rework; unclear when to stop | DoD: testable + measurable |

## Error Flow: Phase 35-38 Shortcut (DO NOT REPEAT)

```
❌ WRONG:
Phase README → Code (skip plan + checklist) → Progress Doc (scatter, incomplete)
            → Pull request with unclear scope
            → Retro says "we don't know what was planned"
```

```
✅ RIGHT:
Phase README → Sprint Plan (user stories + technical spec)
            → Sprint Checklist (task breakdown + DoD)
            → Code (implement against checklist)
            → Update Checklist (daily: [ ] → [x])
            → Progress Doc (daily progress + retrospective)
            → Pull request with full traceability
            → Retro: "estimate accuracy 85%; unblock story X.Y for next sprint"
```

## Daily Workflow Example

**Morning (9 AM)**:
1. Review `claudedocs/3-progress/daily/` latest entry
2. Open sprint checklist (e.g., `sprint-49-1-checklist.md`)
3. Today's tasks: **Day 2.1 — 2.4** (estimated 6 hours)
4. Create feature branch if first day

**During work**:
- Per-task estimate vs actual; mark `[x]` immediately upon completion
- If blocked, add `🚧 阻塞 (HH:MM): <reason>` and switch to another task
- Commit per logical unit with sprint scope in message

**End of day (4 PM)**:
1. Update checklist (today's done tasks `[x]`)
2. Commit checklist changes
3. Write `progress.md` entry (estimate vs actual + notes)
4. Create FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR record if applicable

---

## Before Commit Checklist

Every commit must pass:

1. **Correspond to Sprint Checklist**
   - Commit message matches task ID
   - Checklist `[ ]` → `[x]` done before or immediately after commit

2. **Lint + Format** (from code-quality.md)
   - Backend: `black . && isort . && flake8 . && mypy .`
   - Frontend: `npm run lint && npm run build`

3. **Tests Passing**
   - Backend: `pytest` (>= 80% coverage for new code)
   - Frontend: `npm run test` (>= 80% coverage)

4. **Sprint Workflow Compliance** (anti-patterns-checklist.md 11 points)

5. **No Prohibited Imports**
   - Backend agent_harness: no direct `import openai` / `import anthropic`

6. **File Headers Updated** (file-header-convention.md)

---

## Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Force push to main
- ❌ Commit without corresponding checklist entry
- ❌ Delete unchecked `[ ]` items from checklist
- ❌ Skip progress.md updates (update daily)
- ❌ Skip FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR records for bug/feature changes
- ❌ Code before plan + checklist exist
- ❌ Commit secrets, large binaries, generated files
- ❌ Scope creep without updating plan
