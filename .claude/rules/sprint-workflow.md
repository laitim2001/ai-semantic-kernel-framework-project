## Overview

This document enforces the **mandatory 5-step sprint execution flow** used in V2 (Phase 49+). Phase 35-38 violated this flow by skipping plan + checklist, leading to scattered implementation and poor traceability.

**Golden Rule**: `Phase README → Sprint Plan → Sprint Checklist → Code → Update Checklist → Progress Doc`

---

## Mandatory 5-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Create Plan File

**Before writing any code**, create sprint plan at `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-planning/phase-XX-name/sprint-XX-Y-plan.md`.

**Required Sections**:
- **Sprint Goal**: One sentence. What does this sprint deliver?
- **User Stories**: 3-5 stories in "As a / I want / So that" format
- **Technical Specifications**: Design decisions, architecture rationale, technology choices
- **File Change List**: Explicit list of all files to be created/modified (with counts)
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable, testable definition of done
- **Deliverables**: `- [ ]` checkbox list mapping to stories
- **Dependencies & Risks**: What could block? What's the mitigation?

**Reference Template**: **The most recent completed sprint's plan** (NOT a fixed reference like 49.1; always the latest closed sprint). As of 2026-04-30, that's `phase-51-tools-memory/sprint-51-2-plan.md` (9 sections, 0-9). Mirror its section count, naming, and detail level exactly. Sprint scope differences must be expressed through **content** (more stories / more files), **never through structure** (don't add sections, don't rename §5/§6/§7).

**Why**: Prevents vague scope. Forces thinking before coding. Becomes sprint contract. Format consistency lets reviewer / next-session AI navigate any sprint plan with the same mental map.

**Violation Pattern** ❌: "I'll start coding and see what happens" → scattered PRs → unclear scope → Phase 35-38 repeat.

**Violation Pattern** ❌ (Sprint 52.1 v1 — 2026-04-30): Drafted plan with 10 sections + 6 days + custom section names without consulting most recent (51.2) plan format. User had to point out inconsistency; 3 rewrites (v1→v2→v3) before format aligned. **Lesson**: Read prior sprint plan FIRST, then mirror exactly.

#### Workload Calibration (Sprint 53.7+ — closes AD-Sprint-Plan-1)

Plan §Workload (or equivalent header) **must** state estimate in this three-segment form:

> Bottom-up est ~X hr → calibrated commit ~Y hr (multiplier Z)

- **X** = sum of per-task / per-US bottom-up estimates (raw, no calibration applied)
- **Z** = calibration multiplier in [0.4, 1.0]; default **0.5–0.6** (mid-band 0.55) per 53.4 + 53.5 + 53.6 retrospectives Q2 evidence (3 consecutive ~50% over-estimate; ~7-14 hr banked across 3 sprints)
- **Y** = X × Z = number you actually commit to (PR description / sprint goal acceptance / Day 4 retrospective Q2 baseline)

**When to adjust the multiplier**:
- 3+ consecutive sprints with `actual / committed > 1.2` → raise multiplier (e.g. 0.55 → 0.70) — under-estimating
- 3+ consecutive sprints with `actual / committed < 0.7` → lower multiplier (e.g. 0.55 → 0.40) — buffer too generous
- Single-sprint outliers: ignore; 3-sprint moving evidence required

**Day 4 retrospective Q2 must verify the multiplier**:
- Compute `actual_total_hr / committed_total_hr` ratio
- Document delta vs expected `≈ 1.0`
- If `|delta| > 30%`: log `AD-Sprint-Plan-N+1` to revisit multiplier in next plan template iteration

**Why**: Three consecutive ~50% over-estimate sprints (53.4 + 53.5 + 53.6) showed bottom-up estimates consistently double actual; without calibration, sprint commitments were inflated and "banked" hours obscured velocity tracking.

**First plan to apply**: Sprint 53.7 itself (`sprint-53-7-plan.md` §Workload).

---

### Step 2: Create Checklist File

**Immediately after plan approval**, create sprint checklist at `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-planning/phase-XX-name/sprint-XX-Y-checklist.md`.

**Required Format**:
```markdown
# Sprint XX.Y — Checklist

[Link to plan]

## Day N — Task Group

### N.M Task Description
- [ ] **Specific deliverable**
  - DoD: Measurable definition of done
  - Command: `git ...` or `pytest ...`
- [ ] **Next deliverable**
  - ...
```

**Key Rules**:
- Use `- [ ]` format
- Each task should be a single logical unit (break down if checklist entry covers >1 commit's worth of work)
- Include DoD (Definition of Done) — how to verify
- Map each task to plan's acceptance criteria
- Assign to days (Day 1-5 for typical sprint)
- **DO NOT include time estimates in checklist** (since Sprint 55.3 / AD-Lint-2):
  - ❌ ~~`## Day N — Task Group (Estimated X hours)`~~ — drop "(Estimated X hours)" header
  - ❌ ~~`### N.M Task Description (Y min)`~~ — drop "(Y min)" suffix
  - ❌ ~~`- Estimated: Y min`~~ sub-bullets — drop entirely
  - ✅ Sprint-aggregate `Bottom-up est ~X hr → calibrated commit ~Y hr` lives in plan §Workload only
  - ✅ Per-day / per-task actuals (with informal estimates if useful) → progress.md Day entries (individual record, non-binding)
  - **Why** (Sprint 53.7 retrospective Q4 evidence): Day-level estimates have higher variance than sprint-level (banking offset Day N over-runs against budget). Per-day calibrated targets create false precision and trigger anxiety mid-sprint when Day N slips. Sprint-aggregate calibration is the only signal that survives 3-sprint moving evidence (per §Workload Calibration above).

**Reference Template**: **The most recent completed sprint's checklist** (NOT a fixed reference; always the latest closed sprint). As of 2026-04-30, that's `phase-51-tools-memory/sprint-51-2-checklist.md` (~351 lines, Day 0-4, 5 days, ~34 task groups, each task has 3-6 sub-bullets with specific cases/DoD/Verify commands).

**Format Consistency Rule**: Same Day count (5 days, Day 0-4), same per-task detail depth, same DoD/Verify command patterns. Scope differences expressed through **content** (more checkboxes inside a Day), **not structure** (don't add Day 5 / Day 6).

**Violation Pattern** ❌ (Phase 42 Sprint 147): Deleting unchecked `[ ]` items when scope shrinks. This hides what was planned vs. what shipped.

**Violation Pattern** ❌ (Sprint 52.1 v1-v2 — 2026-04-30): First draft used 6 days (Day 0-5); second draft was 27% shorter than 51.2 with insufficient per-task detail. Both required rewrites. **Lesson**: Match prior sprint's day count + detail depth before drafting.

✅ **Correct behavior**: Only change `[ ]` → `[x]`. If scope cuts, leave `[ ]` and note reason in progress.md.

---

### Step 2.5: Day-0 Plan-vs-Repo Verify (Sprint 55.3+ — closes AD-Plan-1; AD-Plan-3 promoted Sprint 55.6)

**Mandatory** between plan/checklist drafting and Day 1 code start. Plans drafted from session memory + retrospective context **drift from real repo** because:

- Class names get renamed between sprints (e.g. `_obs.py` may already exist when plan assumes new file)
- Table names change in Alembic migrations between PR drafts
- Test fixture paths shift when `conftest.py` is restructured
- Service/method signatures evolve in unrelated PRs while plan was being written
- **Wrong-content drift**: file exists but body diverged from plan's claim (e.g. plan asserts `_retry_policy` is dead but path verify alone can't see the body's call sites; or plan asserts ABC `ToolErrorDecision` exists but the ABC was never created)

**Cost when skipped**:
- Sprint 53.7 retrospective Q4 — 5 path-drift findings (D4-D12) cost ~1 hr Day 1+ re-work
- Sprint 55.3 Day 0 — 3 path-drift findings (D1-D3) caught in ~30 min before code starts
- Sprint 55.5 Day 0-2 — **5 wrong-content drifts** (D1+D2+D4+D5+D7) caught via AD-Plan-3 first application; ~55 min cost prevented ~3-4 hr re-work (4-8× ROI)
- Sprint 55.6 Day 0-3 — **11 wrong-content drifts** (D1-D11) caught via AD-Plan-3 second through sixth applications; ~75 min cost prevented ~9-10 hr re-work + 2 production-grade bugs (7-8× quantitative + 2 critical correctness saves)

#### Required actions (Day 0, before Day 1 code)

The verify is a **two-prong grep pass**; both prongs are mandatory:

##### Prong 1 — Path Verify (AD-Plan-2 from Sprint 55.3)

Every file path mentioned in plan §File Change List or §Technical Spec → `Glob` or `ls` to confirm exists / does not exist as expected.

- New files (creates): `Glob("path/to/new_file.py")` returns 0 results
- Edited files (edits): `Glob("path/to/existing.py")` returns 1 result
- DB tables: check `infrastructure/db/models/*.py` + `alembic/versions/*.py`
- Fixture paths: check `tests/**/conftest.py`
- Imports / re-exports: confirm package-level `__init__.py` if plan asserts exposure
- Public ABC methods: read the actual ABC file to confirm signature

##### Prong 2 — Content Verify (AD-Plan-3 promoted Sprint 55.6)

Every plan §Technical Spec / §Background factual claim about existing code → **Grep** for the asserted symbol/pattern in real source. Path-verify alone (Prong 1) is **insufficient**: the file exists, but its body may have diverged from the plan's claim.

Common drift classes and matching grep query patterns:

| Drift class | Plan claim pattern | Grep verify pattern |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Claimed-but-unwired entry points** | "X is dead state" / "Y attribute is unused" | `grep -n "self\._{attribute}\b" {target_file}` — count call sites vs assignments (≥1 assignment / 0 call → confirmed dead) |
| **Claimed-but-missing imports** | "Z is publicly re-exported" / "consumer uses A" | `grep -rn "import {symbol}\|from .* import .*{symbol}" {target_dir}` — confirm import sites |
| **Claimed-but-renamed symbols** | "B was renamed to C" / "D class extends E" | `grep -rn "{old_name}\|{new_name}\|class .* {parent}" {target_dir}` — detect rename / inheritance drift |
| **Claimed-but-non-existent ABCs** | "extend ABC F" / "add G enum case" | `grep -rn "class F\|class G\|F\.{member}" {target_dir}` — confirm ABC actually exists before planning extension |
| **Claimed-but-wrong-units fields** | "uses backoff_seconds" / "stored as float" | `grep -n "{field_name}: " {target_file}` + read 1-3 lines — confirm unit / type assumption |

##### Catalog drift findings

In `progress.md` Day 0 entry under "Drift findings" header:

- Format: `D{N}` ID + Finding + Implication
- Cross-reference to plan §Risks (where finding may shift scope or risk profile)
- **Do NOT silently update plan §Technical Spec** — instead, add finding to plan §Risks. This preserves audit trail of what was originally planned vs. what reality forced. (See `anti-patterns-checklist.md` AP-2 — "no orphan code".)

##### Decide go/no-go for Day 1

- Findings shift scope by ≤ 20% → continue Day 1 with risk noted in §Risks
- Findings shift scope by 20-50% → revise plan §Acceptance Criteria + §Workload, re-confirm with user
- Findings shift scope by > 50% → abort sprint; redraft plan with reality baseline

#### ROI evidence (Sprint 55.6 promotion validation)

AD-Plan-3 was logged Sprint 55.4 candidate, validated Sprint 55.5 first application (5 drifts → 4-8× ROI), and **promoted to validated rule via Sprint 55.6 fold-in** based on cumulative evidence:

| Sprint | Application count | Drifts caught | Cost | Benefit prevented | ROI |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|------|-------------------|-----|
| 55.5 | 1st (Day 0 + 1 + 2) | 5 (D1+D2+D4+D5+D7) | ~55 min | ~3-4 hr re-work | 4-8× |
| 55.6 | 2nd-6th (Day 0-3) | 11 (D1-D11) | ~75 min | ~9-10 hr re-work + 2 production-grade bugs | 7-8× + 2 saves |

**D3 critical scope reduction in Sprint 55.6 alone**: AD-Cat8-2 dropped from "design + wire ~10-12 hr" to "wire-only ~5-6 hr" — caught via content grep (Prong 2), invisible to path verify (Prong 1).

#### Examples

**Sprint 53.7 D4-D12** (9 path-drift findings cost ~1 hr re-work — _why Prong 1 exists_):
- D4: Plan referenced `check_promptbuilder.py --root` arg behavior that did not match script
- D7-D8: Plan assumed lint scripts would silently accept missing `--root` flag; reality = silent-OK or exit 2
- D10-D12: Plan-stated `pytest` count baselines off by 2-5 tests vs. real repo at branch-creation time

**Sprint 55.3 D1-D3** (3 path-drift findings caught _before_ Day 1 code — _Prong 1 ROI validation_):
- D1: Plan assumed sole-mutator refactor needed for `agent_harness/`; grep showed three target patterns already grep-zero → AD-Cat7-1 scope 收斂 to enforcement test + lint
- D2: Plan assumed `verification_span` would be created; `verification/_obs.py` already had it → AD-Cat12-Helpers-1 became `extract` (non-create)
- D3: Plan assumed DB-backed `HITLPolicy` already partially wired; `DefaultHITLManager.default_policy` was in-memory only → AD-Hitl-7 baseline confirmed cleanly

**Sprint 55.6 D3 critical catch** (Prong 2 content-verify — _why AD-Plan-3 promotion exists_):
- 55.4 retro Q4 + 55.5 retro Q4 both narrated "AD-Cat8-2 needs full retry-with-backoff design"
- Day-0 content grep on `loop.py:_handle_tool_error` revealed: ABC implemented, called from main exec, error_policy/error_budget/circuit_breaker ALL wired — **only `_retry_policy` attribute is dead**
- Scope dropped from ~10-12 hr to ~5-6 hr; saved ~5-6 hr scope-creep design work
- Path verify (Prong 1) alone could not catch this: all referenced files exist; content gap requires Prong 2 grep

#### Cross-references

- `anti-patterns-checklist.md` AP-2 (no orphan / phantom code references — drift findings preserve audit trail vs. silent plan rewrite)
- `.claude/rules/file-header-convention.md` §Modification History (drift findings during refactor go in MHist; AD-Lint-MHist-Verbosity char-count budget complements this rule)
- §Common Risk Classes below (recurring drift patterns deserve catalog entries)

✅ **Correct flow**: Plan drafted → Checklist drafted → **Day-0 探勘 grep (Prong 1 path-verify + Prong 2 content-verify) + drift findings catalogued in progress.md** → Day 1 code starts.

❌ **Wrong flow** (Sprint 53.7 pre-AD-Plan-1): Plan drafted → Day 1 code → discover plan-vs-repo gaps mid-implementation → re-work checklist + plan + commits.

❌ **Wrong flow** (Sprint 55.5 pre-AD-Plan-3 first application): Path verify only (Prong 1) → Day 1 code → discover content gaps mid-implementation (file exists but body wrong; ABC doesn't exist; field uses wrong units).

---

### Step 3: Implement Code

**Only after both plan + checklist exist**.

**Workflow**:
1. Review sprint plan + checklist
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/sprint-XX-Y-<scope>` (use scope from git-workflow.md)
3. Code against checklist deliverables (one at a time)
4. Commit frequently (one logical unit per commit)

**Prohibited** ❌:
- Starting code before plan/checklist approved
- Committing without checklist entry
- Scope creep without updating plan + checklist

---

### Step 4: Update Checklist During Implementation

**Daily workflow**:
- Morning: Review today's checklist tasks
- As you complete: `[ ]` → `[x]` (change, never delete)
- If blocked: Add notation `🚧 阻塞：<reason>` below the task, continue working or escalate
- End of day: Commit checklist updates

**Sacred Rule** (Phase 42 Sprint 147 violation):
- ❌ **Never delete** `[ ]` items that weren't done
- ❌ **Never hide** scope cuts by removing lines
- ✅ **Always mark**: `[x]` when done, `[ ]` when not (or abandon formally)

**Why**: Traceability. In retrospective, we see what was planned vs. shipped.

---

### Step 5: Create Progress & Documentation

**Daily (evening)**:
- Update `docs/03-implementation/agent-harness-execution/phase-XX/sprint-XX-Y/progress.md`
- Format:
  ```markdown
  # Sprint XX.Y Progress — YYYY-MM-DD

  ## Today's Accomplishments
  - Task X.Y completed (approx. Z min under/over estimate)
  - Issue: blockers, discoveries

  ## Remaining for Next Day
  - Task X.Z (pre-work done)

  ## Notes
  - Learning / decision / risk
  ```

**Sprint end**:
- Create `retrospective.md` covering: did well / improve next sprint / action items + estimate accuracy %

**Per-day estimates live here** (Sprint 55.3+ — AD-Lint-2 follow-on):
- Since checklist no longer carries "(Estimated X hours)" / "(Y min)" headers, **progress.md is the single home for per-day / per-task time tracking**.
- Format inside "Today's Accomplishments": `Task X.Y — actual Z min (est ~W min, delta ±N%)`
- Sprint-aggregate ratio computed in retrospective.md Q2 from sum of progress.md actuals vs. plan §Workload committed hours.
- Per-task estimates here are **non-binding individual record** — they help calibrate next sprint's bottom-up estimates but do not gate Day N completion.

**What NOT to do** ❌:
- "We'll update docs after the sprint" → too late, details lost
- Skip retrospective → patterns repeat
- Generic notes ("worked on stuff") → no data for future planning

---

## Common Risk Classes (Sprint 53.7+ — closes AD-CI-4)

When drafting plan §Risks, consider these recurring risk classes (V2 carryover evidence). Each entry: `Symptom → Workaround → Long-term fix`.

### Risk Class A: Paths-filter vs `required_status_checks` (CI infra)

**Symptom**: PR只動 `docs/` 或 `.gitignore`（不動 `backend/**` 或 `.github/workflows/**`），導致 GitHub Actions paths-filter 不觸發 backend-ci / V2 Lint。Branch protection `required_status_checks` 仍要求這些 contexts 通過 → mergeStateStatus = `BLOCKED` even though PR is logically clean.

**Source**: Sprint 53.2.5 retrospective (AD-CI-2 / AD-CI-3 origin); Sprint 53.6 Day 2-3 (frontend-only commits had Backend CI skipped — looked like CI broke; required PR-description note).

**Workaround**: 加一個 commit 觸碰 `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`（例如 header comment 註記改動原因），就會觸發 backend-ci + V2 Lint → 必填 contexts 滿足 → PR mergeable. Documented inline in `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` header (since 53.2.5).

**Long-term fix**: AD-CI-5 (`required_status_checks` paths-filter design revisit; possibly switch to GitHub Actions "fall through" / use `if: always()` aggregator job). Independent infra track.

### Risk Class B: Cross-platform `mypy --strict` `unused-ignore` (Python tooling)

**Symptom**: 同一 import / Optional unwrap 在 Linux runner 與 Windows 開發機 mypy 行為不同（缺 stub 包 vs 有 stub 包）。`# type: ignore[X]` 在一邊需要、在另一邊變 `unused-ignore` 報錯（`warn_unused_ignores=true` strict 模式下）。

**Source**: Sprint 52.6 retrospective Q4.

**Workaround**: 雙 ignore code → `# type: ignore[X, unused-ignore]`. 兩邊都不報錯. Documented in `.claude/rules/code-quality.md` §Cross-platform mypy pattern.

**Long-term fix**: Pin Python stub package versions in `pyproject.toml` so both platforms behave identically. Independent.

### Risk Class C: Module-level Singleton Across Test Event Loops (test isolation)

**Symptom**: TestClient-based integration tests 共用 module-level singletons (e.g. `service_factory` cache / `RiskPolicy` DB cache / `MetricsRegistry`) → 第二次 fixture activate 拿到上一個 event loop 的 cached instance → 「event loop closed」cascade fail.

**Source**: Sprint 53.6 Day 4 (US-5 ServiceFactory consolidation introduced; 5 governance / audit tests failed until autouse `reset_service_factory` fixture added).

**Workaround**: Per-suite `conftest.py` autouse fixture calling `reset_*()` for affected singletons. Pattern documented in `.claude/rules/testing.md` §Module-level Singleton Reset Pattern (since 53.7).

**Long-term fix**: Refactor singletons to be DI-injected per-request (no module-level cache); avoids root cause. Per-singleton scope; track as needed.

### How to use this section

When drafting plan §Risks, scan this catalog. If any class applies to your sprint scope, copy the symptom + workaround text into your plan §Risks table. Add new classes here when 2+ sprints hit the same root cause.

## Change Record Conventions

When fixing bugs or implementing features, create corresponding document in `claudedocs/4-changes/`:

| Type | Directory | Naming | When |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| Bug Fix | `4-changes/bug-fixes/` | `FIX-XXX-description.md` | Any bug fix |
| Feature Change | `4-changes/feature-changes/` | `CHANGE-XXX-description.md` | Feature enhancement |
| Refactoring | `4-changes/refactoring/` | `REFACTOR-XXX-description.md` | Code restructure |

**Format** (1 page):
```markdown
# FIX-123: <Description>

**Date**: 2026-05-15
**Sprint**: 50.2
**Scope**: <11+1 category or cross-cutting>

## Problem
2-3 sentences. What was broken?

## Root Cause
Analysis. Why did it happen?

## Solution
What we changed. Code location. PR reference.

## Verification
How we confirmed it's fixed (test name, manual steps).

## Impact
Scope of fix (backend-only? frontend? integration?).
```

**Daily Workflow**:
1. **Morning**: Check `claudedocs/3-progress/daily/` latest log
2. **When fixing bug**: Create `claudedocs/4-changes/bug-fixes/FIX-XXX-<issue>`
3. **When changing feature**: Create `claudedocs/4-changes/feature-changes/CHANGE-XXX-<feature>`
4. **End of day**: Use SITUATION-5 to save progress (which creates daily log entry)

---

## Common Violation Patterns & Consequences

| Pattern | Evidence | Why Bad | Fix |
|---------|----------|---------|-----|
| **Skip Plan** | Code appears without plan.md | Unknown scope → unclear PR → rework | Always: plan → checklist → code |
| **Skip Checklist** | Implementation doesn't track tasks | Can't measure progress; retro blind | Checklist = truth table; mandatory |
| **Delete `[ ]` items** | Checklist shrinks mid-sprint | Hides scope cuts; retro can't diagnose (Phase 42) | Only mark `[x]` or note `[阻塞]` |
| **Update checklist after sprint** | Checklist retroactively filled in | Data quality → estimates useless | Update daily, during work |
| **Skip progress.md** | "Will write at end" | Details lost; retro weak | Write daily 10-min entry |
| **No Change records** | Bugs fixed in silence | No audit trail; same bug reappears | FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR every time |
| **Vague DoD** | "Implement X" → what counts as done? | Infinite rework; unclear when to stop | DoD: testable + measurable |
| 🆕 **Format inconsistency** (Sprint 52.1 v1) | New plan has different section count / naming / Day count than prior completed sprint | Hard to navigate; mental overhead; user must matrix-correct | Read prior sprint's plan + checklist BEFORE drafting; mirror structure; scope differences expressed through content, not structure |

---

## Error Flow: Phase 35-38 Shortcut (DO NOT REPEAT)

```
❌ WRONG:
Phase README → Code (skip plan + checklist) → Progress Doc (scatter, incomplete)
            → Pull request with unclear scope
            → Retro says "we don't know what was planned"
```

```
✅ RIGHT:
Phase README → Sprint Plan (user stories + technical spec)
            → Sprint Checklist (task breakdown + DoD)
            → Code (implement against checklist)
            → Update Checklist (daily: [ ] → [x])
            → Progress Doc (daily progress + retrospective)
            → Pull request with full traceability
            → Retro: "estimate accuracy 85%; unblock story X.Y for next sprint"
```

---

## Daily Workflow Example

**Morning (9 AM)**:
1. Review `claudedocs/3-progress/daily/` latest entry
2. Open sprint checklist (e.g., `sprint-49-1-checklist.md`)
3. Today's tasks: **Day 2.1 — 2.4** (estimated 6 hours)
4. Create feature branch if first day

**During work**:
- Per-task estimate vs actual; mark `[x]` immediately upon completion
- If blocked, add `🚧 阻塞 (HH:MM): <reason>` and switch to another task
- Commit per logical unit with sprint scope in message

**End of day (4 PM)**:
1. Update checklist (today's done tasks `[x]`)
2. Commit checklist changes
3. Write `progress.md` entry (estimate vs actual + notes)
4. Create FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR record if applicable

---

## Before Commit Checklist

Every commit must pass:

1. **Correspond to Sprint Checklist**
   - Commit message matches task ID
   - Checklist `[ ]` → `[x]` done before or immediately after commit

2. **Lint + Format** (from code-quality.md)
   - Backend (per-file format + type chain): `black . && isort . && flake8 . && mypy .`
   - Backend (V2 architecture lints — 6 scripts; closes AD-Lint-1 since Sprint 53.7): `python scripts/lint/run_all.py`
     - One-stop wrapper invokes 6 V2 lints with correct `--root` args (check_ap1: `backend/src` / check_promptbuilder: default `backend/src/agent_harness` / 4 auto-discover)
     - Exit 0 = all 6 green; non-zero = `<failed>/6` with per-script line summary
     - Replaces the prior 6 separate invocations (which silently mis-passed when `--root` arg mismatched script expectation — see Sprint 53.7 Day 0 drift D1)
   - Frontend: `npm run lint && npm run build`

3. **Tests Passing**
   - Backend: `pytest` (>= 80% coverage for new code)
   - Frontend: `npm run test` (>= 80% coverage)

4. **Sprint Workflow Compliance** (anti-patterns-checklist.md 11 points)

5. **No Prohibited Imports**
   - Backend agent_harness: no direct `import openai` / `import anthropic`

6. **File Headers Updated** (file-header-convention.md)

---

## Prohibited Actions

- ❌ Force push to main
- ❌ Commit without corresponding checklist entry
- ❌ Delete unchecked `[ ]` items from checklist
- ❌ Skip progress.md updates (update daily)
- ❌ Skip FIX/CHANGE/REFACTOR records for bug/feature changes
- ❌ Code before plan + checklist exist
- ❌ Commit secrets, large binaries, generated files
- ❌ Scope creep without updating plan
