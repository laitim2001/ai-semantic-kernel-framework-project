# Sprint 57.99 — Checklist (Verification-ESCALATE human-in-the-loop — A2: on max-attempts, conditionally swap the A1 `verification_failed` terminal for a human ESCALATE pause; APPROVE delivers the held answer, REJECT-with-note re-injects one bounded human-coached turn)

**Plan**: [`sprint-57-99-plan.md`](./sprint-57-99-plan.md)
**Created**: 2026-06-10
**Status**: Draft — awaiting user GO for Day-1 code (Day-0 Explore recon already run; design decisions locked via AskUserQuestion 2026-06-10)

> Rule: only `[ ]` → `[x]`; never delete unchecked items; defer with `🚧 + reason`.
> **Feature-continuation** (the 4th pause leg — input/between-turns/output/verification — built from the same 57.91-93 primitive + the A1 gate) → **NO new design note** (`sprint-workflow.md §Step 5.5`, the 57.91-93/95/96 precedent). Record = CHANGE-066 + **update `25-verification-in-loop-design.md` §4** (A2 Open Invariant → SHIPPED) + 17.md (new resume kind). Gate = full backend pytest green (NET delta) + **drive-through PASS** (a strict-judge fail → escalate pause → APPROVE delivers the held answer AND REJECT-with-note re-injects one human-coached turn). Locked decisions (AskUserQuestion 2026-06-10): APPROVE = **deliver the held failed answer (human overrides the judge)**; REJECT-with-note = **one human-coached turn, then terminal**; gating = **global settings toggle `chat_verification_escalate_on_max`, default OFF = A1 preserved**. Out: A3 trace-critique, per-tenant policy (C3), deliver-with-flag, multi-round coaching, dedicated approval UI.

## Day 0 — Plan-vs-Repo Verify + Branch

### 0.1 Three-prong Day-0 verify
- [x] **Prong 1 (path)**: re-confirm the Explore recon anchors (post-A1-merge line numbers) — loop `_cat10_verify_gate :1606` + `_VerifyVerdict :328-347` + `_build_correction_block :350-364` + FAIL==max integration `:2313-2360` (terminal `:2344-2346`, `VERIFICATION_FAILED_STOP_REASON :220`) · `_emit_deferred_pause :1114-1165` (kinds tool `:1053`/input `:1137`/between_turns `:1425`/output `:1588`; checkpoint `:1144`; AWAITING_APPROVAL `:1161`; output `response_snapshot :1591`) · `_cat9_output_escalate_pause :1442-1482` + `_cat9_output_hitl_pause :1484-1604` (ApprovalRequest `:1535-1549`, pending_approval `:1587-1592`) · `_replay_approved_output :3078-3129` (re-emit LLMResponded `:3106`, LoopCompleted END_TURN `:3118`, snapshot fields `:3099-3105`) · `resume() :2750-3076` (get_decision `:2826`; kinds input `:2856-2883`/between_turns `:2884-2914`/output `:2915-2957` replay `:2950`/tool else `:2958-3024`; shared `_run_turns` drive `:3057-3068`) · `__init__ :410-416` (verifier_registry param) · durable counter write `:3185-3186` + resume read (`metadata["verification_attempts"]`) · `ApprovalDecision hitl.py:68-77` (reason `:77`) + `DecisionRequestBody governance/router.py:102-106` (reason max 4096 `:106`) · events `ApprovalRequested/Received events.py:400-408` + `GuardrailTriggered :306` + `VerificationFailed :271-281` · handler verification mode `:265-270` + ctor pass `:456-459`. (progress.md Day-0 Prong 1)
- [x] **Prong 2 (content)**: confirm — (a) the FAIL==max terminal `:2344-2346` has `parsed.text` (held answer) + `verdict` (reasons) + the provider/model/token fields in scope (for the snapshot); (b) `_replay_approved_output`'s snapshot field set (`:3099-3105`) so APPROVE can reuse it; (c) `resume()` reads `decision.reason` on the get_decision path (so REJECT can read the note); (d) the durable `verification_attempts` write/read pattern (`:3185-3186` + resume) so `verification_escalated` mirrors it; (e) the `core/config` settings module location + how `chat_verification_mode` is declared (so the new toggle matches the pattern); (f) the 3 `handler.py` builders that construct `AgentLoopImpl` (so all 3 thread the toggle); (g) `_emit_deferred_pause`'s `kind` is a free string (no enum) so `"verification"` is additive. (progress.md Day-0 Prong 2)
- [x] **Prong 2.5 (drift)**: confirm — **D1**: `resume()`'s `kind` dispatch is an `if/elif` chain (so `elif kind == "verification":` is additive, no exhaustiveness consumer breaks). **D2**: the held-answer snapshot can be built at the terminal point (all `_replay_approved_output` fields in scope at `:2344`), else capture them earlier. **D3**: the REJECT continuation can drive `_run_turns` with `verification_attempts=max` + `verification_escalated=True` to bound to one turn (the FAIL==max branch reads `verification_escalated`). **D4**: `LoopCompleted` + `ApprovalRequested(HIGH)` reused (no new event — the 57.93 precedent). (progress.md Day-0 Prong 2.5)
- [x] **Prong 3 (schema)**: N/A — no DB/migration/ORM change (the durable bool rides the existing `state_snapshots` JSONB checkpoint metadata, the 57.98 precedent); no new event type (`ApprovalRequested`/`ApprovalReceived`/`GuardrailTriggered`/`VerificationFailed` already wire-serialized → `check_event_schema_sync` unaffected); no new DTO (the note rides `ApprovalDecision.reason`). Confirm no new table/column/event/DTO.
- [x] **Baseline capture**: baseline = `main` HEAD (57.99 branched from `be89d3ec`; pytest collect = **2298** (`-m "not real_llm"`); mypy `src` = **0/353**; run_all 10/10 to confirm Day-0; record NET delta after edits)
- [x] **Design-note decision**: A2 = feature-continuation → NO new design note (the 57.91-93 precedent). Confirm in progress.md + plan to UPDATE `25-verification-in-loop-design.md` §4 (A2 Open Invariant → SHIPPED) instead.
- [x] **Strict-judge drive-through setup**: identify how to force a real verification fail for the Day-3 drive-through (a strict judge template / a deliberately-hard prompt) without faking — the 57.98 carryover `strict-judge drive-through template`; Day-0 note the approach + that the cheap deployment (57.97) is set
- [x] Catalogue Day-0/Day-1 drift in progress.md; **go/no-go decision = GO** (feasibility: the recon confirmed A2 = a new pause method + one conditional terminal branch + one resume kind + a settings toggle + a durable bool; the conditional bits = the snapshot field match + the REJECT bound + the strict-judge fail)

### 0.2 Branch
- [x] Branch `feature/sprint-57-99-verification-escalate` from `main` (`be89d3ec`)
- [ ] plan + checklist + progress committed (Day-0 commit)

---

## Day 1 — Config toggle + the escalate pause (US-1/US-2)

### 1.1 The config toggle (US-1)
- [ ] **`core/config` setting** — add `chat_verification_escalate_on_max: bool = False` (env `CHAT_VERIFICATION_ESCALATE_ON_MAX`); `.env.example` documents it; MHist
  - DoD: `mypy src --strict` 0; the setting reads from env with a False default
- [ ] **`orchestrator_loop/loop.py` `__init__`** — add `verification_escalate_on_max: bool = False` (store `self._verification_escalate_on_max`); MHist
  - DoD: existing construction sites build (optional param, default False)
- [ ] **`api/v1/chat/handler.py`** — all 3 builders read `settings.chat_verification_escalate_on_max` + pass `verification_escalate_on_max=` into `AgentLoopImpl(...)`; MHist
  - DoD: the toggle threads settings → handler → ctor; regression green (default False = A1 unchanged)

### 1.2 The escalate pause (US-2)
- [ ] **NEW `_cat10_verification_escalate_pause()`** (mirrors `_cat9_output_hitl_pause`) — build the held-answer + verifier-reasons `response_snapshot` (the `_replay_approved_output` field set), create the `ApprovalRequest` (`"kind":"verification"`, `risk_level="HIGH"`, reasons in the payload), emit `ApprovalRequested(HIGH)`, build `pending_approval` (`kind="verification"` + `response_snapshot`), call `_emit_deferred_pause(kind="verification", ...)`, persist `verification_escalated=True`; MHist
  - DoD: unit-tested — toggle ON + FAIL==max → `ApprovalRequested(HIGH)` + `awaiting_approval` checkpoint carrying the held answer + reason
- [ ] **Conditional FAIL==max branch** (`:2344`) — `if self._verification_escalate_on_max and not verification_escalated:` → `async for ev in self._cat10_verification_escalate_pause(...): yield ev; return`; `else:` → the A1 `LoopCompleted(verification_failed)` (byte-identical); MHist
  - DoD: toggle OFF → the A1 terminal byte-identical (the A1 gate tests stay green); toggle ON + not-escalated → the pause fires
- [ ] **Durable `verification_escalated` write** — `_emit_state_checkpoint`/`_emit_deferred_pause` write `metadata["verification_escalated"]` when True (mirror `verification_attempts :3185-3186`); thread into `_run_turns` as a param (`verification_escalated: bool = False`); MHist
  - DoD: the escalate checkpoint carries `metadata["verification_escalated"]=True`
- [ ] **mypy clean** on the backend files (full `src --strict` 0)

---

## Day 2 — Resume APPROVE / REJECT-with-note + the durable bound (US-3/US-4/US-5)

### 2.1 Resume APPROVE → deliver the held answer (US-3)
- [ ] **`resume()` `elif kind == "verification":` APPROVED** — re-emit the held failed answer via the `_replay_approved_output` shape (terminal, no LLM re-call, NOT re-verified); MHist
  - DoD: a test asserts the delivered content == the held failed answer + the verifier is NOT called (replay code-path isolation, the A1 rule)

### 2.2 Resume REJECT-with-note → one bounded human-coached turn (US-4)
- [ ] **`resume()` `kind="verification"` REJECTED** — append `Message(role="user", content="[Verification rejected by reviewer: {decision.reason or 'no reason given'}. Please revise the answer.]")` + drive `_run_turns` with `verification_attempts=self._max_correction_attempts` + `verification_escalated=True`; MHist
  - DoD: the note re-injects (reaches the next chat request) + one `_run_turns` turn runs; PASS → deliver
- [ ] **The bound (reject-then-fail terminates)** — the FAIL==max branch reads `verification_escalated` (from the metadata / the `_run_turns` param) → already-escalated → the A1 terminal (NOT a 2nd escalate)
  - DoD: a test asserts reject-then-fail → `LoopCompleted(verification_failed)` with NO 2nd `ApprovalRequested`

### 2.3 Durable flag survives resume + no new event (US-5)
- [ ] **Durable `verification_escalated` resume read** — `resume()` reads `metadata.get("verification_escalated", False)` → passes to `_run_turns` (mirror the `verification_attempts` resume read); MHist
  - DoD: a pause→resume mid-escalation preserves the flag; a fresh run starts False
- [ ] **No new event** — confirm A2 reuses `ApprovalRequested`/`ApprovalReceived`/`GuardrailTriggered`/`VerificationFailed` (no new event type; `check_event_schema_sync` unaffected)
  - DoD: `grep` no new event class added; `check_event_schema_sync` green

---

## Day 3 — Tests + full regression + drive-through (US-6) + CHANGE-066

### 3.1 Tests (US-1..US-5)
- [ ] **NEW `test_loop_verification_escalate.py`** — toggle OFF → A1 `verification_failed` terminal byte-identical (no `ApprovalRequested`); toggle ON + FAIL==max → escalate pause (`ApprovalRequested(HIGH)` + `awaiting_approval` + held answer + verifier reason); `verification_escalated` persisted
  - DoD: the toggle-OFF byte-identical + the escalate-pause cases pass
- [ ] **NEW resume APPROVE test** — `kind="verification"` APPROVE → the held failed answer is delivered (content matches) + the verifier is NOT re-called
- [ ] **NEW resume REJECT-with-note test** — REJECT → the note re-injects as a `user` Message (reaches the next chat request) + one `_run_turns` turn runs; PASS → deliver
- [ ] **NEW reject-then-fail-terminates test** — REJECT → the human-coached turn FAILS → `LoopCompleted(verification_failed)` (NO 2nd `ApprovalRequested` — the durable bound holds)
- [ ] **NEW durable-flag test** — a pause→resume mid-escalation preserves `verification_escalated`; a fresh run starts False
- [ ] **`test_chat_verification_smoke.py`** — green (toggle-OFF default preserves A1; no escalate)

### 3.2 Full gate sweep
- [ ] **Full backend pytest green (NET delta documented)** — NO test deleted; record baseline (2298 collect) → delta
- [ ] **mypy 0 + run_all 10/10 + format chain** — mypy `src --strict` 0; run_all **10/10** (AP-1 green — the escalate is a conditional `return` in the while-driven `_run_turns`, the reject continuation drives `_run_turns`; `check_event_schema_sync` unaffected; LLM SDK leak 0); black/isort/flake8 **FULL `src/ tests/` scope** clean — run INDEPENDENTLY (no `&&`, no `--silent`; the 57.98 CI-black lesson — full scope, not changed-files subset)

### 3.3 Drive-through (US-6 — strict-judge fail → escalate → approve + reject-coach)
- [ ] **Clean backend restart (Risk Class E)** — kill stale uvicorn reloader + `multiprocessing.spawn` worker (`Get-CimInstance Win32_Process` PID/PPID/StartTime + `Stop-Process -Force`); verify the FRESH PID is the SOLE :8000 owner; frontend node untouched; the toggle read at startup (set `CHAT_VERIFICATION_ESCALATE_ON_MAX=true` + the strict judge for the drive-through backend)
- [ ] **Drove a verification fail → escalate → APPROVE** — a strict judge forces a fail → escalate pause (the HITL card shows the held answer + the verifier reason) → APPROVE → the held answer renders (terminal). Observed-vs-intended in progress.md Day 3 + screenshot
- [ ] **Drove REJECT-with-note → one human-coached turn** — a fresh fail → REJECT with a coaching note → the loop re-answers with the note in context. Observed-vs-intended + screenshot
  - NOTE: if a real fail can't be forced cleanly with a real judge (the 57.98 honest gap), drive the toggle + the pause UI with a forced-fail fixture clearly labelled + unit-prove the escalate/approve/reject mechanism; do NOT claim "gate-only" as drive-through

### 3.4 CHANGE-066 + 25.md §4 + 17.md
- [ ] `claudedocs/4-changes/feature-changes/CHANGE-066-verification-escalate.md` written
- [ ] **`25-verification-in-loop-design.md` §4** — move the "A2 — verification-ESCALATE human-in-the-loop" Open Invariant from deferred → SHIPPED (with the A2 file:line); MHist
- [ ] **`17-cross-category-interfaces.md`** — the `LoopCompleted(verification_failed)` terminal now has a conditional human-ESCALATE alternative; `resume()` gains `kind="verification"` (APPROVE → replay held answer; REJECT → one coached turn); `ApprovalRequested/Received` contracts unchanged

---
