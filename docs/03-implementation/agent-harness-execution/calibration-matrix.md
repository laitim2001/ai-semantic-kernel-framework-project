# Calibration Matrix — live scope-class multipliers + agent_factor

**Purpose**: THE live workload-calibration decision table (scope-class multiplier matrix + Active Agent Delegation Factor Modifier). Read on demand — extracted from the always-loaded `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md` so every session no longer pays its load cost.

## When to read / write this file

- **Plan drafting (Step 1 §Workload)**: look up the scope-class multiplier + agent_factor tier for the 3/4-segment commit form (`sprint-workflow.md §Workload Calibration`).
- **Day 4 closeout (retro Q2)**: append/update your class row — **≤ 1 line (~250 chars)**: verdict + sprint ratio/band + rollback trigger + `→ calibration-log §1` pointer ONLY; full narration → [`calibration-log.md` §1](./calibration-log.md). **Lint-enforced**: `scripts/lint/check_rules_hygiene.py` fails any table row here > 400 chars.
- Adjustment rule (when to re-point a multiplier) = `sprint-workflow.md §Workload Calibration §When to adjust the multiplier` (3-sprint moving window).

## Scope-class multiplier matrix (Sprint 57.6+ — closes AD-Reality-10 + AD-Sprint-Plan-7)

Per AD-Sprint-Plan-4 (logged Sprint 55.3) + 4-sprint window evidence,one-multiplier-fits-all approach loses signal when scope class differs。Below matrix記錄 active classes per scope。`mid-band` value 0.55 for default unclassified scopes;diversification per evidence。

> **Per-class data-point history + per-cell narration + the matrix change log moved** (REFACTOR-005, 2026-05-31; re-extracted REFACTOR-009, 2026-07-14) → [`calibration-log.md` §1](./calibration-log.md). **IMPERATIVE — a matrix cell is ≤ 1 line (~250 chars)**: verdict + sprint ratio/band + rollback trigger + `→ calibration-log §1` pointer ONLY; at closeout the full narration goes to calibration-log §1, NEVER into the cell (enforced via `sprint-workflow.md` §Self-Check at Sprint Closeout + the check_rules_hygiene lint). Adjustment rule = `sprint-workflow.md` §Workload Calibration §When to adjust the multiplier (3-sprint moving window).

## Active Agent Delegation Factor Modifier (ACTIVATED 2026-05-25 — Sprint 57.42 retro structural decision per `AD-Sprint-Plan-Agent-Delegation-Factor-Modifier`)

> **Per-sprint activation/validation history moved** (REFACTOR-005, 2026-05-31): activation evidence, tier-2/3/4 split evolution, per-sprint history (Sprint 57.42→57.62), deprecated baselines → [`calibration-log.md` §2](./calibration-log.md). Below = active rules only (Status + Formula tier-4 table + When + Rollback + Escalation + Tracking discipline).

**Status**: **ACTIVE — Option A multiplicative `agent_factor` coefficient with mid-band start `0.55`**. Closes `AD-Sprint-Plan-Agent-Delegation-Factor-Modifier`. Activation criteria FULLY MET at Sprint 57.42 retro Q4 (5 cross-class data points + 4 consecutive `mockup-strict-rebuild` agent-delegated < 0.7).

**Hypothesis (validated)**: code-implementer agent-delegated frontend work shows ~3-5× speedup vs the human-rewrite cadence the bottom-up estimates assume. Existing per-class multipliers (0.45-0.85) bake in a human-cadence haircut; agent-delegated sprints consistently undershoot the calibrated band lower edge because the haircut isn't enough. Validated by 5 data points (full activation evidence → calibration-log.md §2).

**Formula** (applies from Sprint 57.43+ onwards):

```
effective_calibrated_hours = bottom_up × scope_class_multiplier × agent_factor

where agent_factor = {
  human (default):      1.0
  agent-delegated (tier-4 sub-class table — Sprint 57.55 retro Q4 tier-4 SPLIT ACTIVATED effective 2026-05-28 onwards):
    mechanical-pattern-reuse-heavy:               0.30   (≥ 4 mechanical repetitions of the same template in 1 sprint; KEEP — 57.49 retroactive 0.21 + 57.60 1st forward pt ~1.09 IN band; if a future ≥20×-repetition sprint at 0.30 lands < 0.7 → consider a -high-repetition tier; evidence → calibration-log §2)
    mechanical-greenfield-port-style:             0.45   (single NEW component-pair via mirror-port of existing service shape; predecessor template ≥ 95% internalized; NO NEW Pydantic schema design / UX state design — RESERVED for future port-only sprints)
    mechanical-greenfield-design-decisions:       0.65   (single NEW component-pair WITH new Pydantic schema + UX-state design; tier-4 split VALIDATED 57.56 1.02 + 57.57 1.15 IN band; WATCH: 57.61 0.74 + 57.62 0.77 = 2 consec below cross-shape → next -design-decisions pt < 0.85 → tighten 0.65 → 0.55 (AD-AgentFactor-DesignDecisions-Below-Band-Watch); evidence → calibration-log §2)
    mixed-multidomain-bundle-mechanical:          0.45   (3+ independent tracks WITH a mechanical pattern-reuse component; tightened 0.65 → 0.45 effective 57.60+ after 57.58 + 57.59 2-consec < 0.7; if the next pt under 0.45 is also < 0.7 → escalate 0.30 OR fold into mechanical-pattern-reuse-heavy; evidence → calibration-log §2)
    mixed-multidomain-bundle-non-mechanical:      1.0    (3+ independent tracks of pure audit/docs/rules — NO mechanical reuse; tier-3 split effective 2026-05-27 after 57.51 + 57.52 both > 1.20 at 0.65; evidence → calibration-log §2)
  partial (20-79% via agent):          0.75   (linear interpolation)
  human (<20% via agent):              1.0
  History: 0.55 (57.42 activated) → 0.45 (57.44 tighten) → 0.65 (57.46 rollback) → tier-2/3/4 Option-B sub-class splits (57.48 / 57.50 / 57.52 / 57.55) — full history + rationale → calibration-log §2
}
```

**When `agent-delegated` applies**: ≥ 80% of Day 1 work via code-implementer agent (or equivalent). 20-79% = `partial` (apply `agent_factor = 0.75` linear interpolation; record explicit tag in retro Q2). < 20% = `human` (apply `agent_factor = 1.0`; existing class multiplier alone).

**Rollback rule** (3-sprint window — parallel to existing `When to adjust the multiplier` discipline):
- If activated factor produces **2 sprints with `actual/committed-with-agent-factor` ratio < 0.7** → tighten to `0.45`
- If activated factor produces **1 sprint with ratio > 1.20** → roll back to `0.65` (single-data-point caution)
- If activated factor produces **≥ 2 sprints with ratio > 1.20** → roll back to `1.0` (drop the modifier — agent delegation didn't actually accelerate; class-multiplier alone sufficient)

**Escalation to Option B** (per-class sub-class split — fallback if Option A undershoots specific classes):
- If `0.55` produces ratio < 0.7 OR > 1.20 for **≥ 2 specific classes** over 3-sprint window → switch from Option A to Option B per-class split (add `+ agent-delegated` sub-row for each high-volume class; proposed baseline ranges: `-with-extras` 0.30-0.40 / `mockup-strict-rebuild` 0.25-0.35 / `verbatim-css-repoint -simple` 0.25-0.30; matches existing matrix granularity)

**Tracking discipline** (MANDATORY from Sprint 57.43+):

Each agent-delegated sprint MUST record in retrospective Q2:
1. `actual/bottom-up` ratio (existing)
2. `actual/committed` ratio (now `committed = bottom_up × scope_class_mult × agent_factor`)
3. **NEW**: explicit `agent-delegated: yes / no / partial` tag (≥ 80% = `yes`; 20-79% = `partial`; < 20% = `no`)

Sprint plan §Workload Calibration MUST state estimate in the **four-segment form** when agent delegation is anticipated:

> Bottom-up est ~X hr → class-calibrated commit ~Y hr (mult Z) → agent-adjusted commit ~Y' hr (agent_factor 0.55)

where `Y' = Y × 0.55 = X × Z × 0.55`. See `sprint-workflow.md` §Four-segment form.
