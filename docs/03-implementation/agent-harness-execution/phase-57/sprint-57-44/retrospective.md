---

## Q1 — What went well

1. **🎉 Phase-2 epic FULL CLEAN milestone reached**: 21 PARITY + 1 NEAR-PARITY + **0 CATASTROPHIC** remaining. All 5 original drift-audit 2026-05-25 CATASTROPHIC verdicts (governance / verification / memory / admin-tenants / tenant-settings) closed across Sprint 57.40-44 in **5 consecutive sprints**.
2. **Day 0 three-prong verify catalogued 6 D-DAY0-N findings cleanly**: 1 RED (backend schema gap absorbed into pre-anticipated Option A posture per plan §3.3) + 3 YELLOW (absorbable) + 2 GREEN. No plan revision needed. ROI ~3-5× per AD-Plan-3 metric.
3. **Cleanest co-class route-sweep of Phase-2 epic** (tied with Sprint 57.41/42/43): 20 IDENTICAL + 1 INTENDED + 3 sub-300-byte noise + **0 unintended regressions** within 24-route sweep envelope.
4. **Vitest delta beat target by 4-6×**: target +12 → actual +47 (+287-487%). 50 NEW tests across 8 specs all GREEN first run after 1 minor `getAllByText` fix (Sprint 57.41/42/43 cohort lesson internalized).
5. **Backend wire preservation succeeded**: GeneralTab integrates existing `useTenantSettings()` + `useTenantSettingsSave()` hooks unchanged; display_name live PATCH preserved + 4 non-mutable fields shown as disabled fixture displays + BackendGapBanner correctly hints Phase 58+ extension.
6. **Day 1 commit clean** with mockup-ui critical-mass post 57.40-43: 0 new primitive lifts (all 7 mockup-ui primitives — Tabs/Field/Switch/Card/Badge/Button/Icon — reused unchanged); avatar gradient inline-style verbatim port preserved with escape comments.
7. **agent_factor mid-flight stability**: matrix discipline + rollback rule executed predictably under 2nd validation; the framework absorbed the calibration signal without ambiguity.

## Q2 — What didn't go well

### Workload calibration ratio actual/committed-with-agent-factor ≈ 0.20 → 2nd consecutive < 0.7

**Computation**:
- Bottom-up estimate: ~15-20 hr (human-rewrite cadence per plan §8)
- Class-calibrated commit: 15-20 × 0.60 = ~9-12 hr
- **Agent-adjusted commit**: 9-12 × 0.55 = ~5-6.6 hr
- **Actual wall-clock**: Day 0 ~40 min + Day 1 agent 5.5 min + Day 2 agent 8.8 min + Day 2.5 ~10 min + Day 3 ~15 min = **~80 min ≈ 1.3 hr**
- **Ratio actual/committed-with-agent-factor**: 1.3 / 5-6.6 ≈ **0.20-0.26**

**Per `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md §Active Agent Delegation Factor Modifier` rollback rule**:
> "If activated factor produces 2 sprints with `actual/committed-with-agent-factor` ratio < 0.7 → tighten to 0.45"

Sprint 57.43 1st validation = 0.41 (< 0.7) + Sprint 57.44 2nd validation ≈ 0.20 (< 0.7) = **2 consecutive sprints < 0.7** → **rollback rule MET**.

**Decision documented in Q4**: tighten `agent_factor` 0.55 → 0.45.

### Plan bottom-up estimate continues to be ~2.7× generous

Plan estimated NET +690 lines for Day 1; actual NET +256 lines. Consistent with Sprint 57.43 (+1142 squash from plan +230) and broader class history. Bottom-up estimates assume human-rewrite cadence; even after class haircut 0.60 + agent_factor 0.55, residual gap from agent's mockup-direct-port speedup (no human translation friction) still under-models the real speedup.

### MOCKUP-screenshot capture still blocked (Sprint 57.43 carryover continues)

Python http.server + Playwright snapshot flow remains blocked for `page-admin.jsx` (window-mounted React component, not standalone HTML page). Applied Option C byte-proxy deferral per Sprint 57.43 precedent. New carryover `AD-MockupCapture-04-MOCKUP-tenant-settings` opened. AC5 satisfied via byte-proxy threshold proxy.

## Q3 — What we learned

### L1 — Agent_factor mid-band (0.55) systematically over-credits human-rewrite assumption

Even after Option A activation, the residual mockup-direct-port speedup is **larger than the modifier credits**. Two consecutive validations (57.43=0.41 / 57.44≈0.20) at the **same class baseline** (0.60) suggest the residual speedup factor is ~3-5× rather than the 1.8× the 0.55 modifier assumes.

**Generalizable insight**: For mockup-strict-rebuild class specifically, the agent does verbatim port at near machine speed (no human cognitive translation overhead); the bottom-up baseline implicitly assumes a human porter who reads mockup, translates to TS, and types. Eliminating that translation step compresses time 5-8× — the 0.55 modifier only credits ~1.8×.

**Implication for Sprint 57.45+**: 0.45 will likely still over-credit (target ratio ≈ 0.20 / 0.45/0.55 ≈ 0.16 even at 0.45). Predicted Sprint 57.45 ratio under 0.45 ≈ 0.24 — still BELOW band. If 0.45 produces < 0.7 again, escalation to 0.35 or Option B per-class split may be needed.

### L2 — Class-multi-data-point stability with 10-pt sample size

`frontend-mockup-strict-rebuild` class 9-pt window (post 57.43) mean 0.67 at lower band edge. With Sprint 57.44 as 10th data point at ~0.20 (combined with `agent_factor` adjustment), the 10-pt mean drifts to ~0.62. The class itself is stable; the systematic below-band signal is the **agent-delegation factor**, not class-level drift, per Sprint 57.42 activation hypothesis confirmed.

### L3 — Backend schema gap absorption pattern stable

Sprint 57.43 D-DAY0-6 + Sprint 57.44 D-DAY0-4 both surfaced backend schema gaps at Day 0; both absorbed into pre-anticipated plan §3.3 Option A fixture-first posture without revision. This pattern is now stable for `mockup-strict-rebuild` class — Day 0 Prong 3 Schema verify reliably catches gaps; plan §3.3 reliably anticipates them.

**Generalizable pattern**: For any frontend rebuild touching backend-wired data, plan §3.x "Backend wire posture" section should pre-cite Option A vs Option B branches with concrete criteria. Day 0 Prong 3 selects the branch; no plan revision needed.

### L4 — Carryover `AD-MockupCapture-XX` accumulates without resolution

Sprint 57.43 NEW `AD-MockupCapture-03-MOCKUP-admin-tenants` + Sprint 57.44 NEW `AD-MockupCapture-04-MOCKUP-tenant-settings`. The blocker (mockup is window-mounted React not standalone HTML) is structural. Should be addressed in a dedicated mini-sprint OR accept Option C byte-proxy as the steady-state Phase-2 evidence standard (document in `frontend-mockup-fidelity.md` rule).

## Q4 — Audit Debt deferred + `agent_factor = 0.55` 2nd validation MANDATORY structural decision

### `agent_factor 0.55` 2nd validation result: ratio ~0.20 (BELOW band by ~0.65)

**Rollback rule evaluation** (per `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md §Active Agent Delegation Factor Modifier`):

| Rule | Trigger | Status this sprint |
|------|---------|--------------------|
| "If activated factor produces 2 sprints with ratio < 0.7 → tighten to 0.45" | Sprint 57.43 = 0.41 + Sprint 57.44 = 0.20 | ✅ **MET** |
| "If activated factor produces ≥ 2 sprints with ratio > 1.20 → roll back to 1.0" | n/a (both < 0.7) | ❌ N/A |
| "If 0.55 produces ratio < 0.7 OR > 1.20 for ≥ 2 specific classes over 3-sprint window → Option B per-class split" | Only 1 class (`mockup-strict-rebuild`) data so far | ❌ N/A (single-class signal) |

### **Structural Decision: tighten `agent_factor` 0.55 → 0.45** (effective Sprint 57.45+)

Documented in:
- `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md §Active Agent Delegation Factor Modifier` Activation history Sprint 57.44 entry
- Scope-class multiplier matrix `frontend-mockup-strict-rebuild` row 10th data point

Sprint 57.45+ formula:
```
effective_calibrated_hours = bottom_up × scope_class_multiplier × agent_factor
where agent_factor = {
  human (default):    1.0
  agent-delegated:    0.45   (tightened 2026-05-26 per Sprint 57.44 retro Q4 rollback rule)
}
```

### Predicted Sprint 57.45 ratio under `agent_factor = 0.45`

- Sprint 57.44 actual ratio at 0.55 ≈ 0.20
- Equivalent Sprint 57.45 ratio at 0.45 ≈ 0.20 × (0.55 / 0.45) ≈ **0.24**
- Still below band by ~0.61

**Risk**: If 0.45 also produces < 0.7 (likely), Sprint 57.46 retro Q4 will need to evaluate:
- Tighten further to 0.35 (Sprint 57.45+46 = 2 consecutive < 0.7 at 0.45)
- OR escalate to Option B per-class split with `mockup-strict-rebuild + agent-delegated` sub-class baseline ~0.20-0.25
- OR accept that the modifier framework's mid-band starting point is too generous for verbatim-port agent delegation specifically

### Other carryover Audit Debt

**🆕 NEW from Sprint 57.44**:
- `AD-MockupCapture-04-MOCKUP-tenant-settings` — Day 2.5 MOCKUP byte-proxy deferred (parallel to AD-MockupCapture-03)
- `AD-Sprint-Plan-Agent-Delegation-Factor-2nd-Recalibration` — Sprint 57.46 evaluate 0.45 effectiveness; potential 0.35 or Option B
- `AD-TenantSettings-Backend-Schema-Extension` — Phase 58+ backend extension for region / locale / retention_days / Identity & SSO / seats (parallel to Sprint 57.43 `AD-AdminTenants-Backend-Schema-Extension`)
- `AD-TenantSettings-E2E-Refresh` — Phase 58+ fresh e2e for new 6-tab IA (replacing Karpathy §3 deleted `tenant_settings_view.spec.ts`)

**Carried from Sprint 57.43** (still open):
- 🔴 `AD-AdminTenants-Backend-Schema-Extension` BLOCKING Phase 58+ (independent track)
- `AD-Day0-Prong1-E2E-Glob-Pattern-Broaden` — applied successfully this sprint (broader glob caught 2 e2e specs vs estimated 1)
- `AD-Day0-Prong4-Visual-Baseline-Scope #42` — n/a this sprint (no visual-regression baseline for tenant-settings)
- `AD-VisualBaselineRegen-PR-Permission-Workaround` — n/a (visual-regression baseline regen not needed)

**🟡 Remaining NEAR-PARITY** (post Phase-2 epic close):
- `AD-ChatV2-Inspector-Tab-Rename` (~30 min quick win; deferred to next sprint as separate scope to maintain class purity)

## Q5 — Next steps (rolling candidates per `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md §6` discipline)

**Per rolling planning §6 — DO NOT pre-write Sprint 57.45+ plans here**. Below are candidate directions for user selection:

1. **`AD-ChatV2-Inspector-Tab-Rename`** (~30 min quick win) — closes last 🟡 NEAR-PARITY; **Phase-2 epic FULL CLEAN + NEAR-PARITY CLEAN** combined milestone; also tests `agent_factor = 0.45` 1st validation in a small-scope sprint (low risk for class baseline drift)
2. **`AD-MockupCapture-Method-Resolution`** (~1-2 hr) — address persistent mockup screenshot blocker via either (a) build mockup as standalone HTML in `reference/design-mockups/build/` OR (b) document Option C byte-proxy as steady-state in `frontend-mockup-fidelity.md` rule
3. **Phase 58+ Backend Schema Extension wave**: combined `AD-AdminTenants-Backend-Schema-Extension` + `AD-TenantSettings-Backend-Schema-Extension` (~6-10 hr) — wire 5 of 9 missing TenantListItem columns + 4 missing TenantSettingsResponse fields + add `seats` to schema + audit chain for non-display_name PATCH
4. **`AD-TenantSettings-Backend-Schema-Extension`** alone (~3-5 hr) — narrower; just add region/locale/retention_days/seats + Identity stub for sidecar
5. **Phase 58+ structural epic kickoff** (`AD-Sprint-Plan-Agent-Delegation-Factor-2nd-Recalibration` requires 1+ validation data point first) — defer until small-scope sprint (#1 above) provides 0.45 baseline data

**Strategic context for direction selection**:
- Class purity for next sprint matters (the calibration system needs cleaner signal under 0.45 to assess); a small-scope sprint (#1) preserves that.
- Phase-2 epic FULL CLEAN earned during this sprint; the next milestone target is NEAR-PARITY clean (1 route) — natural progression.
- Backend schema extension is independent track from frontend mockup-fidelity epic; user decides priority.

## Q6 — Solo-dev policy validation

✅ Solo-dev policy holding across Sprint 57.44:
- `required_approving_review_count = 0` permanent (2026-05-03+)
- enforce_admins=true ✅ (cannot bypass via direct push)
- 5 active required CI checks ✅ (will run on PR push)
- PR opened for audit trail + CI gate (not for review approval)
- Day 0/1/2/2.5/3 commits all squash-mergeable on PR

No solo-dev policy edge cases this sprint.

## Q7 — Spike design note 8-Point Quality Gate (N/A — SKIP)

Per `.claude/rules/sprint-workflow.md §5.5 Spike Sprint Design Note Extract Pattern`:
> "若 sprint 是 **feature continuation sprint**（單純擴充已驗證範疇）：**不需** design note；只需 progress.md + retrospective.md"

Sprint 57.44 is a **feature continuation sprint** of the Phase-2 epic (10th application of `frontend-mockup-strict-rebuild` class; established pattern Sprint 57.23+; no new design surface). Q7 **N/A SKIP** per Sprint 57.40-43 cohort precedent (5 consecutive feature-ship sprints with Q7 N/A).
